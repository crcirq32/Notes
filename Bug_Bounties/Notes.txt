    figure out if a company owns a dedicated IP range,
        run several IP-to-ASN translations to see if the IP addresses map to a single ASN
            whois -h whois.cymru.com <ip> (-h retireves info from .cymru. which translates IPS to ASNs)

Certificate Parsing: (Use crt.sh, Censys, and Cert Spotter)
    Can display other domain names of target

Subdomain enumeration: ( Sublist3r, SubBrute, Amass, and Gobuster, sslscan)
    AMass uses DNS zone transfers, cert parsing, search engines, and subdomain DBs.
