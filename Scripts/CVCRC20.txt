	I have experience using Python, R, C/C#/C++, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, MS office/365, SAP, SmartQC, StarLIMS, Linux/Mac/Windows, Tensorflow (w/Keras), Node.js, MySQL, with a Lean Six Sigma Green Belt mindset.
	Growing up I always loved trying to solve problems to make them less of a problem tomorrow. I was accepted to Kennesaw State University in 2008; shortly after I began to assist chemistry labs including inorganic, organic, nursing, and general chemistry. I began research for a Bio-inorganic study. I helped with sample preparation, stability and engineering a stable gold nanoparticle environment. After graduating, I got a job at Nestl√© Purina. I obtained the QA monitor position. I initiated cross training in the QA department. In December 2013 I decided to move to CA. Once I was hired at 3M, I am Lean Six Sigma trained but not yet certified, I spent a lot of time with LSSGB applications at 3M. I had a variety of Kaizen projects dealing with waste management, inventory control (process flow of received materials), FIFO, faster processing of received material, cost reduction of wet chemical testing, revision of controlled forms, and SOP revisions. I completed an IQ/OQ for an Agilent 7900B Gas Chromatograph, an IQ/OQ/PQ for two TruCheck Rover barcode verifiers, and a Pro Forma for a VPSE balance.
	I believe I would be a great addition with Systech Corp, because I feel with my curiosity, drive, and desire for a better future, I could help a great company grow. Please feel free to contact me to set up an interview at 678-656-3222. I hope to hear from you soon.
